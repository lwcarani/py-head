# pyhead

## About
`pyhead` is my version of the Linux-style command line tool named `head`. It is a command line tool that displays the first `n` lines or `c` bytes of a file, where the user can provide the value for `n` and `c`. If no file or value for `n` or `c` is provided, then it displays the first 10 lines from the standard input.

This version is written in Python. 

## Instructions
For Windows, create a folder named `Aliases` in your C drive: `C:/Aliases`. Add this folder to PATH. Next, create a batch file that will execute when you call the specified alias. For example, on my machine, I have a batch file named `head.bat` located at `C:/Aliases`, that contains the following script:

```bat
@echo off
echo.
python C:\...\GitHub\pyhead\main.py %*
```

So now, when I type `head` in the command prompt, this batch file will execute, which in turn, runs the `pyhead` Python script. 

## Examples

`pyhead` allows you to execute typical Linux-style `head` commands. If no flags are included with the filename, it prints the entire file contents:

```cmd
C:\> head hello.txt
hello, world!
```

```cmd
C:\> head small.txt

If no file is included, it displays the first 10 lines from standard input:

```

We can also specify and display only the first `n` lines (note that you can list the flag in any order):

```cmd
